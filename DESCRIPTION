Description: Functions in this package allow one to employ the panoply of common
    statistical analyses, but with a twist. Every inferential test also uses a
    resampling procedure to generate empirical probability distributions for null
    hypotheses. Simulated and theoretical probability distributions can be compared,
    diagnostics for tests are available, and results/output are presented in a
    logical style, consistent with developing appropriate interpretations. This
    package is designed to help BIO532 students navigate the BIO532 course, but it
    should also have general appeal.
