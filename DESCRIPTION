Description: Functions in this package allow one to employ the panoply of common statistical analyses, but with a twist.  
#' Every inferential test also uses a resampling procedure to generate empirical probability distributions for null hypotheses.  
#' Simulated and theoretical probability distributions can be compared, diagnostics for tests are available, and results/output 
#' are presented in a logical style, consistent with developing appropriate interpretations.  This package is designed to help 
#' BIO532 students navigate the BIO532 course, but it should also have general appeal.
